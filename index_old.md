A remarkable feature of living systems is their capacity to self-organize to execute complex physiological and developmental programs. 
Self-organization is fundamentally a multi-scale problem given that molecular interactions (10<sup>-9</sup> m) are translated into emergent cellular- (10<sup>-6</sup> m) and tissue- scale properties (10<sup>-2</sup> m). 

To understand how complex tissue behaviors emerge from molecular mechanisms my research merges molecular, cell and developmental biology with the frameworks of fluid mechanics and active matter. 

I am interested in understanding self-organization in the context of flow generation by ciliary arrays. I use a variety of multiciliated model organisms to elucidate the two-way link between ciliary activity and flow properties.
