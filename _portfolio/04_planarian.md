In living organisms arrays of thousands of micrometer-scale motile cilia coordinate over several millimeters to transport fluids with diverse rheological properties. Integrated studies of cilia and fluid have been hindered by a lack of experimental systems where cilia and fluid can studied integratively. At the beginning of my postdoc I explored several conventional and non conventional model organisms that could be employed to study quantitatively and systematically flow generation by arrays of cilia. I developed tools to use the planarian flatworm S.mediterranea as the first experimental model system, in which cilia, fluid and their interactions can be imaged and probed from the micrometer cilia- to the millimeter fluid- scale. 

Planarians glide by secreting mucus on their ventral surface and use motile cilia to move the mucus. As part of my postdoctoral work I am studying how changes in cilia density impact the generation of organism scale fluid flow. In parallel I built a library of RNAi constructs to perform a screen to discover new molecular regulators of cilia, fluid and their interactions. Using these tools my future research  will identify the biophysical parameters that control global flow and uncover the feedback mechanisms between cilia and fluid. The long term goal of my research program is to construct a phase diagram, identifying the physical parameters of cilia and fluid that control the state of macroscopic flow. To truly understand how physical observables interface with biological mechanisms I aim to uncover the molecular pathways that control these key parameters. 
I will present my results on how changes in cilia density impact flow generation at the American Society for Cell Biology meeting, stop by poster P2014 on Monday, December 10 if youâ€™d like to hear more about this work.
