In living organisms arrays of thousands of micrometer-scale motile cilia coordinate over centimeters to transport fluid. Tissues need to accommodate a variety of specialized cell types, thus cilia cannot cover surfaces uniformly. However, we do not understand how a discontinuous carpets of cilia can generate long-range directed flows. I am currently combining measurements of cilia organization in the mouse airway with a reduced order hydrodynamic model, to study how spatial organization of cilia integrates across scales to produce long-range flows. I have found that there is a surprisingly high level of heterogeneity in the orientation of cilia within individual cells and across the tissue. Despite this spatial heterogeneity, this array of cilia is able to generate long-range steady directed flows. I will present my results at the American Physical Society March meeting so you can attend my talk if you'd like to hear the complete story. Also, stay tuned for a preprint on this work soon!
