Ciliated tissues need to accommodate a variety of specialized cell types, thus in ciliated cells do not cover surfaces uniformly. Yet, we do not understand how discontinuous carpets of cilia generate long-range flows. Combining measurements of cilia organization in the mouse airway with a reduced order hydrodynamic model, I studied how spatial organization of cilia integrates across scales to produce a directed flow. I found that there is a surprisingly high level of heterogeneity in the orientation of cilia within individual cells and across the tissue. Despite this spatial heterogeneity, this array of cilia generates long-range steady directed flow over minute timescales. I will present these results at the American Physical Society March meeting, please attend my talk if you'd like to hear more about this work. Also, stay tuned for a preprint coming soon!
